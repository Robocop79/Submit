Constitution is adopted.</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, serif"><FONT SIZE=6 STYLE="font-size: 26pt">
The constitution creates separate executive, judicial, and
legislative branches of government so that one group or person cannot
hold all of the power. It also includes articles protecting civil
liberties (freedoms) such as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly
(freedom to meet in public), and freedom of religion. The
constitution also protects privacy so that individuals cannot be
searched without the court’s permission.</FONT></FONT></P>

1919 — The Weimar Constitution includes Article 48. This article
suspends the constitution in times of emergency, allowing the
president to make rules without the consent of the parliament and to
suspend (put on hold) civil rights, like freedom of speech, in order
to protect public safety. Many people thought this article was a good
idea because there were so many political parties in Germany that
sometimes it was difficult for them to agree enough to pass any laws.
At times of crisis, like the inflation Germany suffered in 1923 or
the depression in 1929, it was important for government to respond
quickly and not be withheld from action by politicians who cannot
agree. Thus, many Germans thought it would be wise to have a clause
in the constitution that would allow the president to take over and
make quick decisions in </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, serif"><FONT SIZE=6 STYLE="font-size: 26pt"><U><B>times

28, 1933 — Hitler uses the emergency power of the president to
issue two laws. He says the purpose of these laws was to protect
public safety. The first law allows the government to search and
confiscate private property. Government officials are now permitted
to read mail and to take belongings from people’s homes. The other
law allows him to arrest anyone belonging to rival political parties,
especially communists. Because of Article 48 these laws do not need
to be approved by the Reichstag. If a majority of the members of the
Reichstag do not approve of a law, they still have the power to veto
it. But, with many of his opposition jailed or scared to speak out,
none of Hitler’s laws get vetoed.</FONT></FONT></P>

23, 1933 — Hitler announces the Enabling Act, which is then
approved by the Reichstag. The Enabling Act gives Hitler dictatorial
powers for four years. It allows (or “enables”) Hitler to punish
anyone he considers an enemy of the state. This law also says that
Hitler can pass laws that are against the ideas in the constitution.
Some members of parliament do not agree with this law. While some
opponents of the Enabling Act vote against it, many opponents of the
law are in jail or in hiding. So there are not enough votes in
parliament to veto the Enabling Act.</FONT></FONT></P>

1930—Membership to the Nazi party had dwindled to roughly 800,000
men and women by 1928.  Hitler knew the only way to achieve the
political greatness he hoped for was if a miracle happened.  And that
miracle came in the form of the October 1929 Stock Market Crash in
the United States.  The US fell into a deep, dark depression and by
September of 1930 they called the German Government to return their
unpaid loans.  This sent Germany right back into financial crisis.
This event allowed Hitler to travel around the country, giving speech
after speech over the ineffectiveness of the Weimar Republic. At the
end of 1930, the Nazi membership rose to a sharp 6.5 million! </FONT></FONT>
