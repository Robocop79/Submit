Hitler&#8217;s Ladder to Power Timeline	
</h1>
	
<p>
August 1919 — Weimar Constitution is adopted. The constitution creates separate executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government so that one group or person cannot hold all of the power. It also includes articles protecting civil liberties (freedoms) such as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly (freedom to meet in public), and freedom of religion. The constitution also protects privacy so that individuals cannot be searched without the court’s permission.
<br><br>
August 1919 — The Weimar Constitution includes Article 48. This article suspends the constitution in times of emergency, allowing the president to make rules without the consent of the parliament and to suspend (put on hold) civil rights, like freedom of speech, in order to protect public safety. Many people thought this article was a good idea because there were so many political parties in Germany that sometimes it was difficult for them to agree enough to pass any laws. At times of crisis, like the inflation Germany suffered in 1923 or the depression in 1929, it was important for government to respond quickly and not be withheld from action by politicians who cannot agree. Thus, many Germans thought it would be wise to have a clause in the constitution that would allow the president to take over and make quick decisions in times of emergency.

November 8-9, 1923—Adolf Hitler (1889-1945) and his followers staged the Beer Hall Putsch in Munich, a failed attempt to overthrow the government in Bavaria, a state in southern Germany, against the supporters of the Weimar Republic. Because of this failed “putsch,” or takeover, which resulted in the deaths of 16 Nazis and 4 Police Officers, Hitler was convicted of treason (crime of going against the government) and sentenced to five years in prison. The public trial turned Hitler into a National figure.
<br><br>
1924—After being arrested for the Beer Hall Putsch (attempted overthrow of the government in 1923), Hitler faced a 24 day public trial for his crime, where he was convicted and sentenced to 5 years in prison. While in prison, he wrote his famous book, “Mein Kampf,” (My Struggle) an autobiography in which he outlined his beliefs of racial superiority of the German Race, and his Anti-Semitic viewpoint. After only 9 months in jail, and due to intense pressure of Nazi figures, Hitler was released from prison and resumed his role as Nazi leader.
<br><br>
September 1930—Membership to the Nazi party had dwindled to roughly 800,000 men and women by 1928. Hitler knew the only way to achieve the political greatness he hoped for was if a miracle happened. And that miracle came in the form of the October 1929 Stock Market Crash in the United States. The US fell into a deep, dark depression and by September of 1930 they called the German Government to return their unpaid loans. This sent Germany right back into financial crisis. This event allowed Hitler to travel around the country, giving speech after speech over the ineffectiveness of the Weimar Republic. At the end of 1930, the Nazi membership rose to a sharp 6.5 million!
<br><br>
July 1932 — The Nazi Party wins 37% of the votes in the 1932 election. For the first time, the Nazis are the largest and most powerful political party in Germany. Still, over half of the German citizens do not vote for the Nazis and they still do not have enough seats in the Reichstag (government) to be able to pass laws without getting additional votes from representatives from other political parties.
<br><br>
November 1932 — The Nazi Party wins 33% of the votes, but they still have more seats in the Reichstag (government) than any other political party.
<br><br>
January 1933 — German President Paul von Hindenburg understands that he will need the support of the Nazi Party to get any laws passed. As a result of the success of the Nazi Party in the elections, President Hindenburg appoints Hitler to the position of Chancellor—the head of parliament. (So basically he is the Senate Majority Leader)
<br><br>
February 1,1933 — Hitler proclaims the new government of Germany by speaking directly to the German people on the radio, not by speaking to members of parliament. He declares, “[The] new national government will consider it its first and supreme duty to restore our nation’s unity of will and spirit. . . . In place of turbulent instincts, the government will once again make national discipline our guide.” A parade is held in Hitler’s honor.
<br><br>
February 27, 1933 — The Reichstag (parliament) building catches on fire. Hitler quickly blames the communists, a rival political party. Hitler convinces President Hindenburg to invoke Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution in order to protect public safety.
<br><br>
February 28, 1933 — Hitler uses the emergency power of the president to issue two laws. He says the purpose of these laws was to protect public safety. The first law allows the government to search and confiscate private property. Government officials are now permitted to read mail and to take belongings from people’s homes. The other law allows him to arrest anyone belonging to rival political parties, especially communists. Because of Article 48 these laws do not need to be approved by the Reichstag. If a majority of the members of the Reichstag do not approve of a law, they still have the power to veto it. But, with many of his opposition jailed or scared to speak out, none of Hitler’s laws get vetoed.
<br><br>
March 11, 1933 — Hitler creates a new government department, the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. The purpose of this department is to spread Hitler’s ideas among the German public.
<br><br>
March 23, 1933 — Hitler opens a jail for people he thinks are plotting to overthrow the government, especially members of the Communist Party. These jails were called “concentration camps” because they concentrated a targeted or undesirable group of people in one place where they can be monitored.
<br><br>
March 23, 1933 — Hitler announces the Enabling Act, which is then approved by the Reichstag. The Enabling Act gives Hitler dictatorial powers for four years. It allows (or “enables”) Hitler to punish anyone he considers an enemy of the state. This law also says that Hitler can pass laws that are against the ideas in the constitution. Some members of parliament do not agree with this law. While some opponents of the Enabling Act vote against it, many opponents of the law are in jail or in hiding. So there are not enough votes in parliament to veto the Enabling Act.
<br><br>
April 26, 1933 — Hitler organizes a secret state police called the Gestapo to “protect public safety and order.” Gestapo police can arrest people and place them in jail without any oversight by a court or judge.
<br><br>
May 6, 1933 — Nazis begin holding public book burnings. Germans are asked to burn any books considered offensive to Germany, including books by Jewish authors.
<br><br>
August 2, 1934 — President Hindenburg dies. Hitler proposes a new law that would combine the role of president and chancellor in a new position called the Führer (which means “leader” in German). He calls for a vote of the German people.
<br><br>
August 19, 1934 — 95% of registered voters in Germany go to the polls. 90% of these voters approve of Hitler’s law making himself Führer. Now Hitler can say that he became the supreme leader, or dictator, of Germany through the direct will of the people.
