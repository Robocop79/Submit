<p style="line-break: strict;font-size:3vh"><a id="1"></a>1: Angry Birds (King Pig Card): Choose a color. All other players must take turns drawing cards until a player draws a card of the selected color. You then choose the color of play.<br><br><a id="2"></a>2: Batman (The Joker's 3 Card): You have a total of 3 cards to make other players draw. You may distribute these cards in any manner (i.e. 3 cards to 1 person; 1 card to 3 people; etc.).<br><br><a id="3"></a>3: Care Bears (Care-A-Lot Card): After this card is played, all players (in play order) get to play any card from their hand, ending with the person who played the Care-A-Lot card.
