In US v. Strandlof, Judge Holmes said that §2074 was meant to prevent unscrupulous prevaricators both from inciting public panic through false warnings of inclement weather and from lulling the public into a false sense of security through deceptive assurances of sunny skies." <a href="https://t.co/HMKxXQxj8t Sep 06, 2019

For those wondering, this federal crime first appeared in the Agricultural appropriation act of 1905. Notably, it used to prohibit molesting weather maps, but that language has since been removed. <a href=https://t.co/dUaICmKA6w Sep 06, 2019

Then, in 1977, the United States entered into a multilateral convention to prohibit military use of weather modification techniques. <a href=https://t.co/Y2RrKytvMj Aug 27, 2019

The program was first revealed with the release of the Pentagon papers. That same year, Congress passed a new statute requiring the reporting of weather modification activities. <a href=https://t.co/wFxv8FDZTy Aug 27, 2019

But then, in 1972, the New York Times reported on a secret cloud seeding program conducted by the United States to cause rainfall over Vietnam and Laos: <a href="https://t.co/FKI3qkcs29 <a href="https://t.co/aylwBWQIue Aug 26, 2019

Reports submitted to Congress also noted the efforts of *other* countries: <a href=https://t.co/8iHD3NrIft Aug 26, 2019

Eventually, the government stopped pursuing the bomb-kite strategy and moved on to other means of weather modification. In fiscal year 1966, the federal government was spending about $7 million on weather modification efforts. <a href=https://t.co/mIwQf1SP7z Aug 26, 2019

When none of that seemed to work, he started blowing up prairie dog and badger holes because... well... because: <a href=https://t.co/6bOJHBcQgU Aug 26, 2019

He used exploding balloons and even kites with dynamite attached. People wrote letters begging him to stop: <a href=https://t.co/BCaywoTrvv Aug 26, 2019

But, the feds hired Dyrenforth (not a scientist) to go start blowing stuff up. They gave him $9,000. And he issued a pretty comprehensive report: <a href=https://t.co/Dk5fmekwj2 Aug 26, 2019

That was only after a Confederate general had already patented exploding balloons as a means for making it rain. <a href=https://t.co/MFAeZbrd7g Aug 26, 2019

The federal government actually has a history of trying to change the weather by blowing stuff up in the sky. On February 27, 1891, Robert Dyrenforth was appointed "Special Agent of the Department of Agriculture for Making Experiments in the Production of Rainfall." Aug 26, 2019

Well, not without filing the appropriate forms first. 15 USC §330d & 15 CFR §908.3(a)(6) make it a federal crime to try to change the weather using explosives without filing an initial report at least 10 days before bombing the atmosphere. <a href=https://t.co/vlqsnGMJnR Aug 26, 2019

Enough of the "Whale Fucking is non-consensual" bullshit. A Humpback Whale weighs 70,000 pounds, is fifty feet long, can dive more than a quarter mile and can crush ships with a single swipe of its tail. If a human manages to fuck one, you damn well better believe it's consensual.
